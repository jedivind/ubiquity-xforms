This simplified FeedReader shows ATOM and RSS feed data from a specific feed URL.  A selected feed 
from a user specified selection (<xforms:select1>) or from the <selected> default from the feeds.xml is submitted 
and the response from the feed data is unrolled with xforms repeats.  Each repeated row has a "Go" trigger to 
allow the user to browse the specific article, or the user can select the article and read the channel description 
in the textarea at the bottom of the browser.  A user can also add, edit or delete the feed in the select1 list.  
After each action is complete, the feeds.xml file is saved.
