		<h2>Adding XForms Tests</h2>
		<p>
			In order to add a new test, the following procedure should be followed:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create the test form in the appropriate ././html directory.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a document called "TestSomething.html" where Something is the name of 
					the set of tests to run on the test form. This will contain the test 
					instructions in tabular format:
					<ul>
						<li>
							instructions on writing selenese can be found <a href="selenium/reference.html">here</a>,
						</li>
						<li>
							and <a href="xforms/TestOutput.html">TestOutput.html</a> is a reasonable 
							document to use as a kick-start/template.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Add a row:<br />
					&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a 
					href="TestSomething.html">TestSomething&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;tr/>
					<br />
					to the table with @id="suiteTable" in the appropriate TestSuite.html
				</li>
				<li>
					The test will now appear in the list of tests available under the <a href="selenium/core/TestRunner.html">
						Selenium TestRunner.</a>
				</li>
			</ol>
			Important: when writing "open" tests, the path is relative to selenium/core, so 
			in order to reach the testsuite directory, the path will begin with ../../ 
			(Unless you map a drive.)
