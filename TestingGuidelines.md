## Introduction ##

There are three types of testing that are used in Ubiquity XForms. The first is unit-testing, which is used to verify that each component within the system works as expected. Since we use _test-driven development_ (TDD) then unit-tests will be the predominant form of test.

The second type of test is integration testing, where we check that one or more components work together.

And finally we have end-to-end testing, which tests that the entire framework hangs together in the correct manner. There will generally only be a few of these types of test.
