# Introduction #
In the spirit of "distributed agile" teamwork, let's see if it's helpful for each of us to keep a daily entry in the table below highlighting (answers to all not required!):

1. What has happened since yesterday?

2. What are our goals for the day?

3. What is blocking us and/or we need help on?


We don't need to be this formal, i.e. feel free to write whatever makes sense if the above questions are too constricting!

Just overwrite your entry each day so we keep a table with one row per team member...

|Charlie|Pulling together demos for the W3C Tech Plenary using Ubiquity.  Have an urgent need for notification events to work -- at least DOMFocusIn...|

|Rahul  |In a WebKit support spike. Looking at getting model data type information and using that for UI control style and sizing (see [issue 45](https://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/detail?id=45)). Fleshing out details around [styling](StoryStyling.md) for controls.|
|Thomas | Implementing the Forms-a spec using Ubiquity.                                                                                                |
|Mark\_Mc| I am basically finished with the new Testsuite that contains the test files in the xforms-tests-and-examples branch. Most of the Selenium test cases are in that branch now. The new Testsuite might work now in IE, but more testing still needs to be done. FF3 Results were added to that branch now, so those results will be added to the Implementation Status wiki soon. |
|Keith  | My primary concern is to qualify the compliance to the W3C 1.1 test suite.  Over the next few days, I intend to determine the issues for the purchase order sample from John, continue to focus on issues such as XHMTL (FF/XML parser), the instance @resource ([issue 75](https://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/detail?id=75)), submission@resource ([issue 80](https://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/detail?id=80)), and output @mediatype ([issue 81](https://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/detail?id=81)). I have started looking at [issue 61](https://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/detail?id=61), especially the itemset side. |
