# Introduction #

There was quite a long gap between later versions of 0.6, and this 0.7 release, because contributors were working hard to obtain a high level of XForms 1.1 conformance, leaving little time to prepare releases.

That's not to say that this release only contains XForms 1.1 features; below you'll find information about how to add Google maps to your forms, the new rollup file (which should speed up form loading), how BuildBot is helping contributors to test their work, and much more.

In fact, you'll find that since the last release, contributors have added [over 220 bug-fixes, enhancements and new features](http://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/list?can=1&q=closed-after:2008/10/31+status:fixed&sort=-id&colspec=ID+Type+Priority+Status+Summary+Component#).

## Highlights ##

### Rollup file ###

From a deployment standpoint, the most important development is the new roll-up file, which includes the entire library in one file. Of course we will improve on this by also compressing the file, but even in its current form, developers should see a big improvement in performance.

The file is currently re-generated by our BuildBot server, every time a change is committed to trunk. ([Status of the rollup generation](http://uxf-bb.webbackplane.com:8080/builders/rollup).) The actual rollup file is available from the [home-page of the BuildBot server](http://uxf-bb.webbackplane.com:8080/). Until we deploy it properly it should be copied to your server, and referenced as described in UsingTheLibrary.

### Submission ###

XForms 1.1 supports a number of important improvements to submission, and UXF supports pretty much all of them, including the `xf:header` element.

For details of the new features, see [Enhanced Submissions](http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#intro-diffs-submission) in the XForms 1.1 specification.

### Validation improvements ###

UXF now supports validation against the XForms predefined datatypes.

For details of the new features, see [Datatypes and Model Item Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#intro-diffs-datatypes-mips) in the XForms 1.1 specification.

### Map controls ###

UXF makes adding maps to your forms as easy as placing a CSS class value on an `xf:output` or `xf:range`.

Examples are in the [map controls sample](http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.7.0/samples/map-controls.html).

## New features ##

The following new features have been added in this release:

  * conditional action handlers are now available via `@if`;
  * messages can be displayed using `xf:message`;
  * more XPath functions have been implemented, such as `context()`, `event()` and `id()`;
  * the `xf:repeat` start index (`@start`) is now taken into account;
  * the `xf:toggle` and `xf:setindex` action handlers have been added;
  * the `xf:method` child of `xf:submission` is now supported;
  * there is SOAP support on POST submissions;
  * support for some of the semantics of XForms in HTML has been added;
  * `@incremental` is now working for `xf:input`, `xf:secret`, `xf:textarea` and `xf:range`;
  * SHA-256 support has been added to the `hmac()` and `digest()` XPath functions;
  * file writing is available, by using the `file:` scheme and the PUT method in submission;
  * file reading is also available, by using the `file:` scheme and the GET method in submission;
  * more control over how a user navigates a form is available via`@navindex` and `@accesskey`;
  * `xf:input`'s that bind to boolean data will now render as a check-box.

## Improvements to the test system ##

The following improvements have been made to the test system:

  * hands-free execution of unit tests;
  * W3C Test Suite now uses the Selenium Test Harness;
  * there are more Selenium user extensions for XForms-specific testing;
  * a Buildbot server has been setup for automated testing and results generation.

## Various miscellaneous changes ##

The following are mainly enhancements to existing features, or bug fixes:

  * improvements to form controls, such as `xf:range`, `xf:select` and `xf:select1` controls;
  * improvements to `xf:repeat`;
  * improvements to action handlers, such as `xf:insert`, `xf:delete` and `xf:load`;
  * improvements to resource handling in submission, via `xf:resource`;
  * improvements to messaging, via `xf:hint` and `xf:alert`;
  * improvements to the processing model and the events generated;
  * improvements in MIP handling;
  * lazy-authoring improvements;
  * fixed dynamic relevance on `xf:group`;
  * various style improvements for form controls;
  * SVN has been better organized, which means that the directory structure differs from release v0.6.2.
