		<h2>Running Tests</h2>

			<p>
				<strong>The Selenium core has been upgraded from 0.8.0 to 0.8.2.</strong><br/>
				The reason is that we needed a fix for a problem with the <em>waitFor*</em> actions, where they were never
				actually timing out. (Does Selenium not test itself with Selenium?)
			</p>
			<p>
				Everything should be much as it was, with the only major change being that the URLs use in driver
				pages are now relative to the test file, rather than relative to <em>TestRunner.html</em>. In the longer term
				this is actually better, because it makes it easier to relocate a test suite. But in the short term, until we
				change our URLs, it will break all of our tests. Fortunately, 0.8.2 also provides a new parameter
				which can be used to get around this, called <em>baseUrl</em>, but the problem with that is that it
				must be absolute. Which means that the following links will no longer work, until we modify the URLs.

		<h2>Adding XForms Tests</h2>
		<p>
			In order to add a new test, the following procedure should be followed:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Create the test form in the appropriate ././html directory.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a document called "TestSomething.html" where Something is the name of 
					the set of tests to run on the test form. This will contain the test 
					instructions in tabular format:
					<ul>
						<li>
							instructions on writing selenese can be found <a href="selenium/reference.html">here</a>,
						</li>
						<li>
							and <a href="xforms/TestOutput.html">TestOutput.html</a> is a reasonable 
							document to use as a kick-start/template.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Add a row:<br />
					&lt;tr>&lt;td>&lt;a 
					href="TestSomething.html">TestSomething&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;tr/>
					<br />
					to the table with @id="suiteTable" in the appropriate TestSuite.html
				</li>
				<li>
					The test will now appear in the list of tests available under the <a href="selenium/core/TestRunner.html">
						Selenium TestRunner.</a>
				</li>
			</ol>
			Important: when writing "open" tests, the path is relative to selenium/core, so 
			in order to reach the testsuite directory, the path will begin with ../../ 
			(Unless you map a drive.)
