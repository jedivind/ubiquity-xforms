#summary W3C selenium testing and results instruction.

= Introduction =

The W3C XForms 1.1 Test Suite has been incorporated into the Ubiquity-xforms project to facilitate compliance testing.  You can checkout a copy of the trunk to your local environment and start the selenium testing by selecting the *Run W3C Selenium Tests*.  Visit this link for more information about [http://seleniumhq.org/ Selenium].

= Details =

You can quickly see the results of the Selenium testing by observing the background colors of the listed tests.  Red indicates the test or selenium cmd failed, and green indicates the test or selenium cmd passed.  There are some tests which are highlighted in red text to indicate the test is not enabled for Selenium.

The [http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/html/index.html W3C XForms 1.1 Test Suite] has a driver to run the individual tests by chapters in the XForms 1.1 specification.  Further, the W3C XForms 1.1 test suite has an [http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/forms/index.xhtml XForms mode] (not yet working with Ubiquity-XForms) which allows a user to mark individual tests as passed or failed and the date of the observed state.  These results can be saved to a local file system (e.g. if you were testing Chapter 2, select *2. Introduction to XForms*, select test 2.1.a _Introductory Example No. 1_ and depending on the success of the test case return back to the chapter 2 page and select 'Passed', 'Failed', or unknown status and select a date with the calendar control).  You can select the *Save* button to save the results to the folder ../Results/XF11_02_Results.xml. 

There is a ResultsTable document written with XForms which can display the results of these Results from the manual testing of the W3C XForms 1.1 Test Suite. But because of various reasons, we had to go to amore X/HTML oriented approach.  So to view the Results from above, you will need to transform the XML files above to X/HTML.  To do this
