#summary Generate XForms Bind Element for Streamlined syntax.

= Introduction =
In our current implementation, xforms's bind elements are processed 
during rebuild of the model. The only option to dynamic generate a bind
element is to:

1. create a bind element in xforms namespace with bind's attributes
2. insert the created bind node to the xforms model
3. call rebuild which in result will process *all* the binds.
