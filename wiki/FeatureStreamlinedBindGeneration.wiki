#summary Generate XForms Bind Element for Streamlined syntax.

= Introduction =
In our current implementation, xforms's bind elements are processed 
during rebuild of the model. The only way to dynamic generate a bind
element is:

  # Create a bind element in xforms namespace with bind's attributes
  # Insert the created bind node to the xforms model
  # Call rebuild() which in result will process the binds.
