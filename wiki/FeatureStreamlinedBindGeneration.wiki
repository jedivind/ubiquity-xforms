#summary Generate XForms Bind Element for Streamlined syntax.

= Introduction =
In our current implementation, xforms's bind elements are processed 
during rebuild of the model. The only option to dynamic generate a bind
element is:

  # create a bind element in xforms namespace with bind's attributes
  # insert the created bind node to the xforms model
  # call rebuild which in result will process *all* the binds.
