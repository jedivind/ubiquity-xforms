#summary A simple feature to add would be a colour-picker as a range control
#labels Phase-Design

The YUI library contains a colour-picker, as illustrated [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/button/btn_example11.html here]. This could be invoked in XForms using either of the following techniques:
{{{
<xf:range ref="x" appearance="ux:color-picker">
  ...
</xf:range>
}}}
{{{
<xf:select1 ref="x" appearance="ux:color-picker">
  ...
</xf:select1>
}}}
An enhancement to this would be to include predefined values. This could allow the user to choose any colour from the palette, or to pick a saved one from the list:
{{{
<xf:select1 ref="x" appearance="ux:color-picker">
  <xf:label>Background colour:</xf:label>
  <xf:itemset nodset="saved-colors">
    <xf:label ref="label"></xf:label>
    <xf:value ref="value"></xf:value>
  </xf:itemset>
</xf:select1>
}}}
