= Introduction =

Implementation details for the XForms [http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#action-message Message] Element.

== Implementation ==

xf:message elements have an @level attribute that can be "modal", "modeless", or "ephemeral".  The default is "modal".

A "modal" xf:message is displaying pretty nicely in a dialog window.  Since it is "modal", you have to click on the OK button before you can do anything else on the page.

A "modeless" xf:message is displaying pretty nicely in a dialog window.  Since it is "modeless", you can still select on other buttons and type words on the page.

I made the xf:message's OK button visible with the code that I added in lib/xforms/actions.js. I also made the xf:message display correctly with the code that I added in default.css.  The xf:message and it's header look a lot better with these settings.

A "ephemeral" xf:message works pretty well.  It displays in a tooltip, like xf:hint (not in a dialog window).  But, it still needs work, because the message does not always appear where it should.

@ref & @value are supported.

xf:output elements inside a xf:message are supported, even though the message can contain the inline text when you only want the instance text (see issue 46).
