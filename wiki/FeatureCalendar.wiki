#summary A calendar control
#labels Feature,Phase-Design

The YUI library contains a calendar control, as illustrated [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/button/btn_example09.html here] and [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/button/btn_example10.html here]. This could be invoked in XForms using the an {{{xf:input}}} control, bound to a node of type {{{xsd:date}}}:
{{{
<xf:model>
  <xf:instance>
    <inst xmlns="">
      <d />
    </inst>
  </xf:instance>

  <xf:bind nodeset="d" type="xsd:date" />
</xf:model>

<xf:input ref="d">
  ...
</xf:input>
}}}
However, we should also allow an {{{xf:select1}}} that is bound to a date to render the same thing.

The YUI calendar control allows for multiple values to be selected, as illustrated [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/multi.html here]; we should make this feature available by using {{{xf:select}}}.

The YUI calendar control also allows a start and end date to be specified, which limits the user's choice, as illustrated [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/calendar/minmax.html here]; we should make this feature available by using {{{xf:range}}}. The example on the YUI site could be marked up like this:
{{{
<xf:range ref="d" start="2008-01-05" end="2008-01-15">
  ...
</xf:range>
}}}

Finally, all of the above options should be available to the author without having to use {{{@type}}}, simply by setting {{{@datatype}}} or {{{@appearance}}} on the control itself:
{{{
<xf:input ref="d" appearance="yui:calendar">
  ...
</xf:input>
}}}
{{{
<xf:input ref="d" datatype="xsd:date">
  ...
</xf:input>
}}}

The above variants currently produce a _static_ calendar. A popup calendar is desired on many occassions. The following option should produce an input field with a button that can be used to popup the calendar for selecting a date:
{{{
<xf:input ref="d" appearance="yui:popup-calendar">
  ...
</xf:input>
}}}
