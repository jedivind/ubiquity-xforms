= Introduction =

It should be possible to style various bits in the anatomy of a control separately -- be it:
 * the {{{<xf:label>}}},
 * the {{{<xf:hint>}}},
 * the {{{<xf:alert>}}} or
 * the control itself.
 * the container element of the control, i.e. the {{{<xf:input}}} etc itself.  Might be used to influence the local layout of label relative to the body of the control for example.

= Details =

Architecturally, this is enabled by using the child pseudo-element ({{{pe-value}}}) to hold the control itself. We need to flesh this out, document it and add examples.
