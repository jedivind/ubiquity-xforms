= Introduction =

It should be possible to style various bits in the anatomy of a control separately -- be it:
 * the {{{<xf:label>}}},
 * the {{{<xf:hint>}}},
 * the {{{<xf:alert>}}} or
 * the control itself.

= Details =

Architecturally, this is enabled by using the child pseudo-element ({{{pe-value}}}) to hold the control itself. We need to flesh this out, document it and add examples.
