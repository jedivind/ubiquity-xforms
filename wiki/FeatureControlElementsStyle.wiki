= Introduction =

It is possible to style various bits in the anatomy of a control separately -- be it:
  * the {{{xf:label}}},
  * the {{{xf:hint}}},
  * the {{{xf:alert}}},
  * {{{xf:item}}}s and {{{xf:choice}}}s in a selection list,
  * the control itself,
  * the container element of the control, e.g., the {{{xf:input}}} element itself, which can be used to influence the local layout of label relative to the body of the control for example.

= Details =

Architecturally, this is enabled by the child pseudo-element ({{{pe-value}}}) to hold the control itself, as described in [http://www.formsplayer.com/node/121 anatomy of a control] on the formsPlayer site.

We need to document this as part of the broader documentation on how controls work.
