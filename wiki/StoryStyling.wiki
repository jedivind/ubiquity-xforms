#summary Adjusting look and feel using UX.
#labels Story

= Introduction =

UX should allow for styling core form controls, custom controls, and container controls. There may be one or more predefined themes to allow for quick skinning of RIAs.

= Details =

Some of the requirements are:

 * UX should specify a default homogeneous style for various controls.
 * It should be possible for developers to define their own _themes_ or _skins_.

Styling should be possible at various levels of granularity:

 * It should be possible to apply themes to entire applications / pages.
 * It should be possible to apply styles to controls individually.
 * It should be possible to style pieces within controls. For example, it should be possible to style the label of a control differently from the control itself.
