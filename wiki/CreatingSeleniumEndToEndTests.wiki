Blah blah.

= XForms 1.1 Test Suite =

The XForms 1.1 test suite comprises:

  * a file that lists all of the tests to run;
  * individual test forms;
  * a driver file for each test.

== List of tests to run ==

The higher Selenium XForms 1.1 test suite is located at:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/W3CTestSuite.html
}}}

This is currently being broken into individual chapters, such as:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/TestSuiteChapter11.html
}}}

== Individual test forms ==

Each of the XForms 1.1 tests has an XForm located in a sub-directory of:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1
}}}
The tests are broken down by chapter, and then section (and sometimes even sub-section). For example, test `11.1.n` would be in section `11.1` in chapter 11:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/Chapt11/11.1/11.1.n.xhtml
}}}

= Running the tests =

The Selenium driver file is at:
{{{
testsuite/selenium/core/TestRunner.html
}}}

To run the chapter 11 tests, for example, use the following:
{{{
testsuite/selenium/core/TestRunner.html?test=../../W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/TestSuiteChapter11.html
}}}
