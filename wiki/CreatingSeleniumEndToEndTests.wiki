Blah blah.

= XForms 1.1 Test Suite =

The XForms 1.1 test suite comprises:

  * a file that lists all of the tests to run, in the form of links to 'driver pages';
  * a driver page for each test, which links to one or more individual test forms;
  * a set of individual test forms;

== List of tests to run ==

The top level list of XForms 1.1 tests to run is located at:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/W3CTestSuite.html
}}}

This is currently being broken into individual chapters, such as:

{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/TestSuiteChapter11.html
}}}

Each entry in the document is a link to driver file to be loaded, plus a title for the test. These entries appear as rows in a table:

{{{
<table id="suiteTable" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1" class="selenium">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>XForms 1.1 Chapter 11 Test Suite</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td><a href="./Chapt11/11.1/11.1.a.html">11.1.a ref attribute of submission element</a></td></tr>
    <tr><td><a href="./Chapt11/11.1/11.1.b.html">11.1.b bind attribute of submission element</a></td></tr>
    .
    .
    .
    <tr><td><a href="./Chapt11/11.11/11.11.4/11.11.4.b.html">11.11.4.b handling SOAP success response</a></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
}}}

== Driver pages ==

Each driver page is an HTML file that contains a list of instructions that Selenium will understand (for more details see the [http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/0.8.0/reference.html Selenium Reference]). These are located in:

{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests
}}}

The driver pages are broken down by chapter, and then section (and sometimes even sub-section). For example, test `11.1.n` would be in section `11.1` in chapter 11:

{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/Chapt11/11.1/11.1.n.html
}}}

== Individual test forms ==

Each of the XForms 1.1 tests has an XForm located in a sub-directory of:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1
}}}
The tests are broken down by chapter, and then section (and sometimes even sub-section). For example, test `11.1.n` would be in section `11.1` in chapter 11:
{{{
testsuite/W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/Chapt11/11.1/11.1.n.xhtml
}}}

= Running the tests =

The Selenium driver file is at:
{{{
testsuite/selenium/core/TestRunner.html
}}}

To run the chapter 11 tests, for example, use the following:
{{{
testsuite/selenium/core/TestRunner.html?test=../../W3C-XForms-1.1/Edition1/driverPages/SeleniumTests/TestSuiteChapter11.html
}}}
