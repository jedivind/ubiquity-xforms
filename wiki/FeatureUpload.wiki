= Introduction =

Implementation details for the XForms [http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms11/#ui-upload Upload] Element.

== Implementation ==

@mediatype & @incremental (both optional) should be supported.

The form only works with the datatypes of xsd:anyURI, xsd:base64Binary, or xsd:hexBinary.

The implementation will probably have its own javascript file.  In that file, there will be support for a text field and a Browse... button.  When button is clicked, a window with local file system will come up (which may be really tricky to do).

Definitely, more implementation to come.

== Stories ==

  * A user will be allowed to upload a file from the local file system.
