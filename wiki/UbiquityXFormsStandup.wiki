#summary Daily heads-up on what we're each working on...
#labels Featured,HowTo

= Introduction =
In the spirit of "distributed agile" teamwork, let's see if it's helpful for each of us to keep a daily entry in the table below highlighting (answers to all not required!):

1. What has happened since yesterday?

2. What are our goals for the day?

3. What is blocking us and/or we need help on?


We don't need to be this formal, i.e. feel free to write whatever makes sense if the above questions are too constricting!

Just overwrite your entry each day so we keep a table with one row per team member...

||Charlie||Working with Rahul and Thomas to evolve the stories around styling -- both for CSS and for layout of container elements (group, repeat, switch).  Starting simple to make the loan form look better (issue 32).||
||Rahul||Waiting for feedback on [http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/branches/calendar/ calendar branch] (related to issue 39) and [http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/branches/colorpicker/ colorpicker branch]. Working on John's suggestions for the calendar variants using {{{minimal}}}, {{{compact}}} and {{{full}}} values of the {{{appearance}}} attribute. Fleshing out stories around [StoryStyling styling] (for controls -- starting with field width and label vs. control) and [StoryLayouts layouts] (starting with flow based for xf:group).||
||Thomas|| Fleshing out stories around [StoryStyling styling] starting with group style (horiontal & vertical & controls flow)||
||Mark_Mc|| Finishing xf:alert. I am now merging my branch into the trunk. The IE support will be added as an issue along with the other issues I have to still add. ||
