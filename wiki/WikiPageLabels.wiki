#summary Commonly used labels for the UX wiki.
#labels HowTo

= Introduction =

*Q1:* We are using conventions for wiki page names (such as feature pages beginning with Feature). Why do we need labels?

_A1:_ Labels make searching a lot easier. And search is King (you should know that).

*Q2:* It says _$label_ below is _Uncommon_ when I try to enter it. Now what?

_A2:_ It works for us. Use it, we rely on all of us using the same labels :-)

= Details =

We use the following labels (please arrange alphabetically, use as many as applicable for any wiki page):

|| *Label* || *Meaning* ||
|| Branch || Information about the branch _owner_, purpose, links to SVN, status and other notes. Lasts while branch exists. ||
|| Feature || Desired feature for UX with background, ideas, code snippets, references. The design palette that can turn into documentation. ||
|| Firefox || Issues, quirks, discussions related to support in the Firefox browser(s). ||
|| HowTo || A tutorial of sorts, for any audience -- developers or contributors. This page is one! ||
|| Index || A listing of other wiki pages, a main page. ||
|| Sample || Page for discussing a specific sample application or example. ||
|| Story || A motivating (set of) scenario(s) for deriving a rich feature set from. ||

This is not a complete list. If additional labels are deemed useful, they should be added here.
