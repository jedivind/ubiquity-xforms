#How to add an XPath function

= Introduction =

XForms relies heavily on XPath for providing different processing functionality. Adding new functions to the library is achieved by 'registering' the function with the UXF processor.

= Details =

The registration function to use is {{{extend()}}}, and the parameter to pass is an object:
{{{
FormsProcessor.extend({
  ...
});
}}}
The object itself will contain your extensions. Eventually this function will support a number of different types of extensions, such as custom widgets, but as of r3092, only XPath functions are supported.

To add an extension function that just adds two numbers together, we only need to provide a property with its name being the name of the function, and its value being the function itself:
{{{
FormsProcessor.extend({
  "add": function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  };
});
}}}
Once registered, the function can be used within any XPath expression. For example:
{{{
<xf:bind nodeset="sum" calculate="add(../a, ../b)" />
}}}
or:
{{{
<xf:setvalue ref="x" calculate="add(., 5)" />
}}}
