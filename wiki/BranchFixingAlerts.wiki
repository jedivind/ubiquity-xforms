XPaths on IE need to be checked case insensitive.  The code was checking case sensitive before, which wasn't working.  The new code checks to see if g_bIsInXHTMLMode is true or false.  If it is false (which it is now for IE), then the code will check XPaths case insensitive.  If it is true (which I think will be supported sometime later for maybe a different situation), then the code will check XPaths case sensitive.

This branch does not fix xf:alerts display.  Another branch will have to do that.
