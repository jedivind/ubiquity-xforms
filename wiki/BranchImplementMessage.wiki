|| Features: || One of the features to consider is FeatureTooltip. (It is used when the message's level is ephemeral.) ||

A "modal" xf:message is displaying pretty nicely in a dialog window.  Since it is "modal", you have to click on the OK button before you can do anything else on the page.

A "modeless" xf:message is displaying pretty nicely in a dialog window.  Since it is "modeless", you can still select on other buttons and type words on the page.

I made the xf:message's OK button visible with the code that I added in lib/xforms/actions.js. I also made the xf:message display correctly with the code that I added in default.css.  The xf:message and it's header look a lot better with these settings.

A "ephemeral" xf:message works pretty well, but it still needs work, because the message does not always appear where it should.

"modal" is the default level of a xf:message.

@ref & @value are supported.

xf:output elements inside a xf:message are supported, even though the message can contain the inline text when you only want the instance text (see issue 46).
