|| Discussion: || To discuss implementation details on this branch, use the [http://groups.google.com/group/ubiquity-xforms-eng/ ubiquity-xforms-eng group], and add {{{[BranchImplementMessage]}}} to your comments. ||
|| Features: || One of the features to consider is FeatureTooltip. (It is used when the message's level is ephemeral.) ||

A "modal" message is displaying pretty nicely now.

I made the message's OK button visible with the code that I added in lib/xforms/actions.js.

I also made the message display correctly with the code that I added in default.css.  The message and it's header look a lot better with these settings.

-"modeless" and "ephemeral" messages still need work.

-"modal" needs to be the default level of a message.

-@ref & @nodeset need to be supported.

-output elements inside a message need to be supported.
