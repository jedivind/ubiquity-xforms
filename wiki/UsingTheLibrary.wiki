= Introduction =

This section describes how to load the library into your web application.

= Details =

The library is about to undergo a lot of change, which means that the following information is also going to change. However, by using version numbers in the URL it is possible to ensure that the library doesn't change underneath your code.

== Adding the right namespaces ==

The root of the document needs to contain the XForms namespace, as follows:

{{{
<html
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
 xmlns:xf="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms"
>
  ...
</html>
}}}

== A default stylesheet ==

Various parts of XForms require some default styling. At the moment we include that in a simple stylesheet, but it will shortly be incorporated automatically:

{{{
  <head>
    <title>XForms input and output controls</title>
    ...
  </head>
}}}

== Referencing the library ==

To load the library simply refer to the {{{ubiquity-loader.js}}} file in the branch of the latest version. For example:
{{{
    <script src="http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/branches/0.3/ubiquity-loader.js" type="text/javascript">/**/</script>
  </head>
}}}

== Placing the mark-up ==

Conventionally, XForms authors place the {{{model}}} element in the {{{head}}} of the document. However, for the library to work in Firefox, all XForms elements must be placed in the {{{body}}}:
{{{
  </head>
  <body>
    <xf:model ...>

    <xf:input ...>

    <xf:output ...>
  </body>
}}}

= A complete example =

A simple XForm that allows a name to be edited, can be created as follows:
{{{
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xf="http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms">
  <head>
    <title>XForms input and output controls</title>
    <script src="http://ubiquity-xforms.googlecode.com/svn/branches/0.3/ubiquity-loader.js" type="text/javascript">/**/</script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <xf:model>
      <xf:instance>
        <data xmlns="">
          <firstname>John</firstname>
          <surname>Doe</surname>
        </data>
      </xf:instance>
    </xf:model>

    <xf:input ref="firstname">
      <xf:label>First Name:</xf:label>
    </xf:input>
    
    <xf:input ref="surname">
      <xf:label>Surname:</xf:label>
    </xf:input>

    <xf:output ref="firstname"><xf:label>First Name:</xf:label></xf:output>
    <xf:output ref="surname"><xf:label>Surname:</xf:label></xf:output>
  </body>
</html>
}}}
