= Introduction =

Herein, I provide a list of issues related to test cases in the W3C-XForms-1.1 test suite.  These issues may either be contrary to or ambiguous regarding the standard; executed with some questionable Selenese; or exercise some feature that ubiquity xforms is incapable of implementing.

= Erroneous tests =

= Not a Scooby =
== digest() and hmac() ==
The tests for digest() and hmac() are currently failing for a reason I can't fathom. The results of the two functions are returning the correct data in all cases. However, the relevance that the tests employ to display the results is not working. So you end up with both the pass and fail messages being displayed for each case. The relevant test cases are 7.8.3.a, 7.8.3.b, 7.8.3.f, 7.8.4.a, 7.8.4.b and 7.8.4.f.
