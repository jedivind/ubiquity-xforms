#summary Story outlining an implementation of the Forms WG simplified syntax for XForms suitable for HTML4 forms authors

= Introduction =

As part of the Forms WG, a simplified syntax for XForms has been proposed along with a mapping onto the equivalent "canonical" XForms notation.  This syntax is summarized in [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-forms/2008Mar/0097.html].  

This story is where we can explore an approach to implementing the simplified syntax in Ubiquity XForms in order to further refine the notation and to be able to show running example forms to other interested parties...

The link above presents a sample form for purchase line items and their totals as follows:

{{{
<repeat name="row"> 
    <select1 name="Product"> ... 
    <input name="Price" type="decimal" default="0.00"> ... 
    <input name="Quantity" type="integer" default="0"> ... 
    <output name="LineTotal" calculate="Price * Quantity"/> 
</repeat> 

<output name="Subtotal" calculate="sum(row/LineTotal)"/> 
<output name="Tax" calculate="Subtotal * 0.07"/> 
<output name="Total" calculate="Subtotal + Tax"/> 

}}}

There are many details that result from this notation which are explored at the linked page from the W3C Forms email archive.  This wiki page serves to itemize the resulting Features for the XForms Ubiquity project and to suggest a priority order for implementing them.
