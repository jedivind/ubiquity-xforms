=== Hint ===

For setup, I created a lib/xforms/Hint.js file to have most of the hint code go in there.

So, when a mouseover event happens, it is recognized in the behaviours/decorator.xml file.
I added a some code to check to see if the element contained a hint element (as a child or as itself).  If the element does contain the hint element, the code dispatches a xforms-hint event.

The xforms-hint event is suppose to be recognized by the Hint's contructor, because the Hint's contructor has an EventListener listening for an xforms-hint event, but I don't think that is working right now.  The EventListener then calls the performAction method.  

The performAction method gets the text from the hint element.  Then, the method creates a message by using YAHOO.widget.Tooltip.  It's context is the element where the event came from.  It's text is the text that was just gotten.  And it's autodismissdelay is 2 seconds (which makes the hint message go away after 2 seconds).

I also added some display code in the default.css file to make the hint message look good.

I am still working on the "for" support.

=== Message ===

I updated the message code and it is working better.

I will give more details later.

=== Send ===

I updated the send code and it is working better.

I will give more details later.
