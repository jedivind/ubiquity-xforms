=== Hint ===

For setup, I created a lib/xforms/Hint.js file to have most of the hint code go in there.

So, when a mouseover event happens, it is recognized in the behaviours/decorator.xml file.
I added a some code to check to see if the element contained a hint element (as a child or as itself).  If the element does contain the hint element, the code gets the hint's inline text and passes the element and the text into a Hint's method that shows the hint message.

This method in Hint.js creates a message by using YAHOO.widget.Tooltip.  It's context is the element that was passed in.  It's text is the text that was passed in.  And it's autodismissdelay is 2 seconds (which makes the hint message go away after 2 seconds).
Also this method dispatches a xforms-hint event. 

I also added some display code in the default.css file to make the hint message look good.

This is what I have initially.  I think there is an easier way to do this, but this is what I have so far.  I am still working on making it better.

=== Message ===

I updated the message code and it is working better.

I will give more details later.

=== Send ===

I updated the send code and it is working better.

I will give more details later.
