The inline text of an alert will be used to display an alert element.

When a control form is valid by its 'constraint', the alert will be hidden.  When a control form is invalid by its 'constraint', the alert will to be displayed.

Since the Schema Validation is not supported yet, that part of the alert support is not supported yet either.  I did put two test situations in my alert test case that test this and fail.  When the Schema Validation is supported, those situations should pass (I think).
