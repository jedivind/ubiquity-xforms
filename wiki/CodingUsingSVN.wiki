#summary Development Contribution Process with SVN and Eclipse Subversive Instructions.

= Developing the Code =

Contributors have the option of working on the trunk code, but *do not commit* without code reviews, as described below.  The code review process is similar when a branch is used. 

For the first draft of this page, the instructions include the specifics for using Eclipse with subversive.  In the future of this page, the specific SVN command-line instructions will be added, which can be harvested from an older development process description [http://code.google.com/p/ubiquity/wiki/CodingUsingSvn here].

At the end of this page, there are also some instructions on setting up Subversive in Eclipse.
