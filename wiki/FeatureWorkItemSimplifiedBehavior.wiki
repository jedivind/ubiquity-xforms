= Introduction =

Add support of the [StorySimplifiedSyntax streamlined syntax] to the Ubiquity XForms's namespace


= Details =

For a quick implementation of the streamlined syntax, we purpose the followings:

1.  Add the decorator, and implement for the new streamlined elements:
  * form - it generates an empty model for the streamlined form.
2. Add the decorator rules for the following elements with a *name* attribute (the name attribute is used as an identifier of streamlined element)
  * group 
  * input
  * hidden
  * output
  * submit
3. Design and implement a Streamlined Behavior Object which attached to all streamlined elements and performs the following:
  * Generate the referenced node in the instance
  * Extract the bindings, calculations, constriants information from the element and store it in a *binding information stack*.
4. After the model is created and the document is processed, 
  * Add the generated instance to the model
  * Generate all the bindings from the *binding information stack* and attached it to the model.

= Future Work Item =
The above design should provide the basic features of the streamlined syntax,
then we will look into how to  provide support for [WorkItemSupportHtmlInput Streamlined Syntax elements in HTML namespace].
