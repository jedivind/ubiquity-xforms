#summary An overview of plans for the Ubiquity XForms library.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

Most of the initial work on the library will focus on reorganising the modules so as to make it easier to add the various new features that are planned.

Once this work is complete work will continue to:
  * add features to make the library XForms 1.1 compatible;
  * add interfaces to allow functionality to be provided by other Ajax libraries;
  * ensure that the library can be used within other libraries.

== Version 0.2 ==

This version will make use of the YUI Module loader, rather than our own custom one. This is because the YUI loader supports specifying dependencies between modules, which in turn requires an examination of those dependencies. This information is important to have before we try to add more modules, or split apart existing modules. In the longer term we will enable the use of different loaders, such as the Dojo one. (See [http://code.google.com/p/ubiquity-xforms/issues/detail?id=4 issue #4].)
