#summary a localName function.

= Introduction =

The *getLowerCaseLocalName* function returns the non-namespace-qualified name of a given node, in lowerCase.  Both Firefox and Internet Explorer ignore case and report nodeNames as uppercase, but most element names in the scope of this project are officially lowercase.  Therefore a function that returns a consistently lowercase version of the name is desirable.

= Usage =

{{{
name = NamespaceManager.getLowerCaseLocalName(node)
}}}

= Parameters =

|| node || The node for which the local name is desired. ||


= Return Value =

The local part of the name of "node"
