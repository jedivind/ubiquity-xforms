The initial code for the project was developed by [Mark Birbeck](http://webBackplane.com/mark-birbeck/) and [Paul Butcher](http://webBackplane.com/paul-butcher/).

IBM has provided funding for the initial code to be placed into open source under the Apache v2.0 license and for development of the initial code into XForms 1.1 conformant processors for the Internet Explorer, FireFox and Safari web browsers.

Ubiquity XForms relies on a number of other open-source libraries and tools.

  * [Brian Turek's jsSHA](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jssha/)
  * [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/)
  * [The Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI)](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui)
